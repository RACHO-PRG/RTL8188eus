# Supports
* Android 7
* MESH Support
* Monitor mode
* Frame injection
* Up to kernel v5.8+
... And a bunch of various wifi chipsets

# Howto build/install
1. You will need to blacklist another driver in order to use this one.
2. `echo 'blacklist r8188eu'|sudo tee -a '/etc/modprobe.d/realtek.conf'`
3. `cd rtl8188eus`
4. `make && sudo make install`
5. Reboot in order to blacklist and load the new driver/module.

# MONITOR MODE howto
Use these steps to enter monitor mode.
```
$ sudo airmon-ng check kill
$ sudo ip link set <interface> down
$ sudo iw dev <interface> set type monitor
```
Frame injection test may be performed with
(after kernel v5.2 scanning is slow, run a scan or simply an airodump-ng first!)
```
$ aireplay -9 <interface>
```

# DISABLE MONITOR MODE howto
Use these steps to disable monitor mode. (not possible if your device's MAC address is added to `unmanaged-devices` variable under "NetworkManager.conf")
```
$ sudo service NetworkManager start
$ sudo iw dev <interface> set type managed
$ sudo ip link set <interface> up
```
If the adapter still refuses to go back, try:
```
$ sudo service NetworkManager restart
```

# NetworkManager configuration
Copy "NetworkManager.conf" to "NetworkManager.conf.bak" to create a backup.
Add these lines below to "NetworkManager.conf" and ADD YOUR ADAPTER MAC below [keyfile].
This will make the Network-Manager ignore the device, and therefore don't cause problems.
```
[device]
wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no

[ifupdown]
managed=false

[connection]
wifi.powersave=0

[main]
plugins=keyfile

[keyfile]
unmanaged-devices=A0:B1:C2:D3:E4:F5 #Your device's MAC address here
```

# Zabid Sabih lesson tips

If you are are taking "Learn Ethical Hacking From Scratch | Udemy" by Zaid Sabih and using Kali 2022 x64 Customized by zSecurity 1.0.7 and TP-Link TL-WN722N v2/v3 [Realtek RTL8188EUS], you might find this helpful.

In the begining, I am able to enter monitor mode. However after a few days, I found out it doesn't allow to enter monitor mode. I think TP-Link TL-WN722N v2/v3 have automatically updated its driver.

Then, I find a video from [David Bombal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYnjMiTTdms) but still can't perfectly solve the issue. However, I find below steps work fine for me.

1. `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get full-upgrade`
2. Reboot in order to load the new kernel (if downloaded).
3. `sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) bc build-essential libelf-dev dkms`
4. `sudo rmmod r8188eu.ko`
5. `git https://github.com/drygdryg/rtl8188eus` (This works for me ðŸ˜‚)
6. `cd rtl8188eus`
7. `echo 'blacklist r8188eu'|sudo tee -a '/etc/modprobe.d/realtek.conf'`
8. `sudo make && make install`
9. Reboot in order to blacklist and load the new driver/module.

# Troubleshooting
Â· You can check your devices by running `sudo iwconfig` or `sudo ifconfig`.<br>
Â· "NetworkManager.conf" is normally under `/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf`.<br>
Â· You need your linux headers installed in order to build this driver.<br>
